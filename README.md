It's going to be on ethereum network. First we'll be selling identical NFT "access tickets" Anyone who mints this NFT will have rights to mint an actual NFT pet Each NFT pet will be 100% unique and there will be 10,000 copies only. First stage would be to get the game fully working as a demo (without integration on the blockchain or to the NFT) as a proof of concept so people who buy the access ticket can play the game and get a feel for it. Once we earn enough money from selling access ticket NFTs we'll be able to hire more people and pay you as well. Hopefully these people such as filipe will be able to help us integrate the game with the block chain, so I would not personally waste time learning something new like that right now, just concentrate on getting the game to work as a proof of concept that NFT access ticket holders can get used to. 
Weighted Traits(example - age would be a more heavily weighted trait):
Hunger %
Thirst %
Happiness %
Friendliness %
Dependance %
Health %
Age %
Domesticated Yes or No + Wild > Domesticated offspring Gen1, Gen2, Gen3â€¦
King pet Yes or No 
Overall Rarity % calculated using all other traits combined 
There needs to be a button to feed, water, play with the pet etc. Pressing the feed button once would give the pet 0% hungry for example 12 hrs and slowly over time the % would rise back up to say 50% hunger and thats when you would feed it next.
There was just a recent NFT project who sold out in 12 minutes and banked more than 20 million $ in ethereum. All for an "access card" not even the final product.
